--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MoXI, which stands for Model Exchange Interlingua, is an intermediate
language meant to be a common input and output standard for model checkers
for finite- and infinite-state systems,
with an initial focus is on finite-state ones.

## General Design Philosophy

MoXI has been designed to be general enough to be an intermediate target language
for a variety of user-facing specification languages for model checking.
At the same time, MoXI is meant to be simple enough to be easily compilable
to lower level languages or be directly supported by model checking tools based
on SAT/SMT technology.

For being an intermediate language, models expressed in MoXI are meant
to be produced and processed by tools, hence it was designed to have

* simple, easily (machine) parsable syntax;
* a rich set of data types;
* minimal syntactic sugar, at least initially;
* well-understood formal semantics;
* a small but comprehensive set of commands;
* simple translations to lower level modeling languages such as
  [Btor2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_32).

Based on these principles, MoXI provides no direct support for many of the features
offered by current hardware modeling languages such as VHDL and Verilog
or more general purpose system modeling languages
such as SMV, TLA+, PROMELA, Simulink, SCADE, Lustre.
However, it strives to offer enough capability so that problems expressed
in those languages can be reduced to problems in MoXI.

MoXI is an extension of the
[SMT-LIB language](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml)
with new commands to define and verify systems.
It allows the definition of multi-component synchronous or
asynchronous reactive systems.
It also allows the specification and checking of reachability conditions
(or, indirectly, state and transition invariants) and deadlocks,
possibly under fairness conditions on input values.

MoXI assumes a discrete and linear notion of time and hence has
a standard trace-based semantics.

Each system definition:

* defines a _transition system_ via the use of SMT formulas,
  imposing minimal syntactic restrictions on those formulas;
* is parametrized by a _state signature_, a sequence of typed variables;
* partitions _state_ variables into _input_, _output_ and _local_ variables;
* can be expressed as the synchronous or asynchronous composition of other systems.

The current focus on _finite-state_ systems.
However, the language has been designed to support the specification
of infinite-state system as well.

## Technical Preliminaries

The base logic of MoXI is the same as that of SMT-LIB:
many-sorted first-order logic with equality and let binders.
We refer to this logic simply as FOL.
When we say _formula_, with no further qualifications, we refer
to an arbitrary formula of FOL (possibly with quantifiers and let binders).
When we say _variable_ we mean a _sorted_ variable, that is, one associated 
with sort (or a _type_, in type theory terminology).

We say that a formula is _quantifier-free_ if it contains no occurrences
of the quantifiers $\forall$ and
$\exists$.
We say that it is _binder-free_ if it is quantifier-free and also contains
no occurrences of the let binder.

The _scope_ of binders and the notion of _free_ and _bound_ (occurrences of)
variables in a formula are defined as usual, that is, the scope is lexical.
Following SMT-LIB's convention, local variables in an expression shadow
global variables with the same name, but not function symbols defined
in the background theory.

### Notation

If $F$ is a formula and
$\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ a tuple of distinct variables,
we write $F[\boldsymbol{x}]$ or $F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ to express the fact
that every variable in $\boldsymbol{x}$ is free in $F$
(although $F$ may have additional free variables).
We write $\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}$ to denote the concatenation
of tuple $\boldsymbol{x}$ with tuple $\boldsymbol{y}$.
When it is clear from the context, given a formula $F[\boldsymbol{x}]$ and
a tuple $\boldsymbol{t} = (t_1, \ldots, t_n)$ of terms of the same type
as $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$,
we write $F[\boldsymbol{t}]$ or $F[t_1, \ldots, t_n]$ to denote the formula
obtained from $F$ by simultaneously replacing each occurrence of $x_i$
by $t_i$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$.

A formula may contain _uninterpreted_ constant and function symbols,
that is, symbols with no constraints on their interpretation.
For most purposes, we treat uninterpreted constant and function symbols
as free (rigid) variables, respectively of first and second order.

### Transition Systems

Formally, a transition system $S$ is a pair of predicates of the form

$$S = (
   I_S [\boldsymbol i, \boldsymbol o,  \boldsymbol l],~
   T_S [\boldsymbol i, \boldsymbol o, \boldsymbol l,
        \boldsymbol{i'}, \boldsymbol{o'}, \boldsymbol{l'}]
)$$

where

* $\boldsymbol i$ and $\boldsymbol{i'}$ are two tuples of _input variables_
  with the same length and type;
* $\boldsymbol o$ and $\boldsymbol{o'}$ are two tuples of _output variables_
  with the same length and type;
* $\boldsymbol l$ and $\boldsymbol{l'}$ are two tuples of _local variables_
  with the same length and type;
* $I_S$ is the system's _initial state condition_, expressed as a formula
  with no (free) variables from $\boldsymbol{i'}$, $\boldsymbol{o'}$, and
  $\boldsymbol{l'}$;
* $T_S$ is the system's _transition condition_, expressed as a formula
  over the variables $\boldsymbol{i}$, $\boldsymbol{o}$, $\boldsymbol{l}$,
  $\boldsymbol{i'}$, $\boldsymbol{o'}$, and $\boldsymbol{l'}$.

> [!NOTE]
For convenience, but differently from other formalizations, a (full) state
of system $S$ is expressed by a valuation of the variables
$\boldsymbol{i},\boldsymbol{o},\boldsymbol{l}$.
In other words, input and output variables are automatically _stateful_
since the transition relation formula can access old values of inputs and outputs
in addition to the old values of the local state.
This means that, technically, $S$ is a (non-deterministic) closed system.
The designation of some state variables as input or output is, however, important
when combining systems together, to capture which of the state values are shared
between two systems being combined, and how.

> [!NOTE]
Similarly to Mealy machines, the initial state condition is also supposed to specify
the initial system's output, based on the initial state and input.
Correspondingly, the transition relation is also supposed to specify the system's output
in every later state of the computation.

> [!NOTE] 
The input and output values corresponding to the transition 
to the _new_ state are those in the variables $\boldsymbol{i'}$ and
$\boldsymbol{o'}$.
The values of $\boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{o}$ are the _old_ input and output values.
>

MoXI focuses on _reactive_ transition systems, that is, transition systems
where every state as a successor.
This is not a limitation in practice for modeling purposes because systems
that have final states can be modeled using states that cycle back to themselves and
produce stuttering outputs.
In fact, as discussed later, the language has syntax for checking an even stronger requirement:
_progressiveness_.


### Trace Semantics

A transition system in the sense above implicitly defines a model
(i.e., a Kripke structure) of First-Order Linear Temporal Logic (FO-LTL).

The language of FO-LTL extends that of FOL with the same modal operators of time
as in standard (propositional) LTL:
$\mathbf{always},$
$\mathbf{eventually},$
$\mathbf{next},$
$\mathbf{until},$
$\mathbf{release}$.
For our purposes of defining the semantics of transition systems,
it is enough to consider just the $\mathbf{always}$ and
$\mathbf{eventually}$ operators.

The set of non-temporal operators depends on the particular theory, in the sense of SMT,
considered (linear integer/real arithmetic, bit vectors, strings, and so on, and
their combinations).
The meaning of theory symbols (such as arithmetic operators) and theory sorts
(such as $\mathsf{Int}$,
$\mathsf{Real},$
$\mathsf{Array(Int, Real)},$
$\mathsf{BitVec(3)}$, $\ldots$)
is fixed by the _background_ theory $\mathcal T$ in question.
Once a theory $\mathcal T$ has been fixed then, the meaning of a FO-LTL formula $F$
is provided by an interpretation of the uninterpreted (constant and function) symbols
of $F$, if any,
as well as an infinite sequence of valuations for the free variables of $F$.

More precisely, let us fix a tuple $\boldsymbol x = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$
of distinct _state_ variables, 
which are intended to represent the state of a computation system.
We will denote by $\boldsymbol{x'}$
the tuple $(x_1',\ldots,x_n')$
and write formulas of the form $F[\boldsymbol f, \boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol x']$
where $\boldsymbol f$ is a tuple of uninterpreted symbols.
If $F$ has free occurrences of variables from $\boldsymbol x$
but not from $\boldsymbol{x'}$ we call it a _one-state_ formula;
otherwise, we call it a _two-state_ formula.

A _valuation of_ $\boldsymbol x$, or a _state over_ $\boldsymbol x$, is a function
mapping each variable $x$ in $\boldsymbol x$ to a value of $x$'s sort.
If $s$ is such a state, we denote by $s(\boldsymbol x)$ the value tuple
$(s(x_1),\ldots, s(x_n))$.
Let $\kappa$ be a positive ordinal up to $\omega$, the cardinality of the natural numbers.
A _trace_ (of length $\kappa$ over $\boldsymbol x$) is
any state sequence $\pi = (s_j  \mid 0 \leq j < \kappa)$.
Note that $\pi$ is the finite sequence $s_0, \ldots, s_{\kappa-1}$
when $\kappa < \omega$ and
is the infinite sequence $s_0, s_1, \ldots$ otherwise.
For all $i$ with $0 \leq i < \kappa$ ,
we denote by $\pi[i]$ the state $s_i$ and
by $\pi^i$ the subsequence
$(s_j \mid i \leq j < \kappa)$.

Let $\mathcal T$ be a theory and let $\mathcal I$ be an interpretation of the symbols
of $\mathcal T$ and of some set $X$ of variables.
If $x$ is a variable in $X$ with sort $\sigma$ and $v$ is a value from the domain of $\sigma$,
we denote by $\mathcal I[x \mapsto v]$ the interpretation
that maps $x$ to $v$ and is otherwise identical to $\mathcal I$.
We extend this notation to $\mathcal I[\boldsymbol x \mapsto \boldsymbol v]$
in the obvious way when $\boldsymbol x$ and $\boldsymbol v$ are tuples
of variables and values, respectively, of the same type.

### Infinite-Trace Semantics

Let $F[\boldsymbol f, \boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol{x'}]$ be a formula as above.
If $\mathcal I$ is an interpretation
of $\boldsymbol{f}$
in the theory $\mathcal T$ and
$\pi$ is an infinite trace,
then $(\mathcal I, \pi)$ _satisfies_ $F$,
written $(\mathcal I, \pi) \models F$, iff one of the following holds:

* $F$ is atomic and
  $\mathcal{I}[\boldsymbol x \mapsto \pi[0](\boldsymbol x)][\boldsymbol{x'} \mapsto \pi[1](\boldsymbol x)]$
  satisfies $F$ as in FOL;
* $F = \lnot G~$ and
  $~(\mathcal I, \pi) \not\models G$;
* $F = G_1 \land G_2~$ and
  $~(\mathcal I, \pi) \models G_i$ for $i=1,2$;
* $F = \exists z\, G$ and
  $(\mathcal I[z \mapsto v], \pi) \models G$ for some value $v$ for $z$;
* $F = \mathbf{eventually}~G$ and
  $(\mathcal I, \pi^i) \models G$ for some $i \geq 0$;
* $F = \mathbf{always}~G$ and
  $(\mathcal I, \pi^i) \models G$ for all $i \geq 0$.
<!-- * $(\mathcal I, \pi^1) \models G$ when $F = \mathbf{next}~G$; -->

The semantics of the propositional connectives $\lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$
and the quantifier $\forall$
can be defined by reduction to the connectives above
(e.g., by defining $G_1 \lor G_2$ as
$\lnot(\lnot G_1 \land \lnot G_2)$ and so on).
Note that $âˆƒ z$ is a _static_, or _rigid_, quantifier:
the meaning of the variable it quantifies does not change over time,
that is, from state to state in $\pi$.
The same is true for uninterpreted symbols.
They are _rigid_ in the same sense: their meaning does not change over time.
Another way to understand the difference between rigid and non-rigid symbols is that
state variables are mutable over time
whereas quantified variables, theory symbols and uninterpreted symbols are all immutable.

Now let

$$S = (I_S [\boldsymbol i, \boldsymbol o,  \boldsymbol l],~
       T_S [\boldsymbol i, \boldsymbol o, \boldsymbol l, \boldsymbol{i'}, \boldsymbol{o'}, \boldsymbol{l'}]
)$$

be a transition system with state variables $\boldsymbol i, \boldsymbol o,  \boldsymbol l$.

The _infinite trace semantics_ of $S$ is the set of all pairs $(\mathcal I, \pi)$
of interpretations $\mathcal I$ in $\mathcal T$ and infinite traces $\pi$ such that

$$(\mathcal I, \pi) \models
  I_S \land\ \mathbf{always}~T_S
$$

We call any such pair an _execution_ of $S$.

### Finite-Trace Semantics

Let $F[\boldsymbol f, \boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol{x'}]$, $\mathcal I$, $\mathcal T$ and $\pi$
be defined is in the subsection above.
For every $n \geq 0$, $(\mathcal I, \pi)$ $n$_-satisfies_ $F$,
written $(\mathcal I, \pi) \models_n F$, iff one of the following holds:

* $F$ is atomic and
  $\mathcal I[\boldsymbol x \mapsto \pi[0](\boldsymbol x), \boldsymbol{x'} \mapsto \pi[1](\boldsymbol x)]$
  satisfies $F$ as in FOL;

* $F = \lnot G$ and $(\mathcal I, \pi) \not\models_n G$;

* $F = G_1 \land G_2$ and $(\mathcal I, \pi) \models_n G_i$ for $i=1,2$;

* $F = \exists z\, G$ and $(\mathcal I[z \mapsto v], \pi) \models_n G$ for some value $v$ for $z$;

* $F = \mathbf{eventually}~G$ and $(\mathcal I, \pi^i) \models_{n-i} G$ for some $i = 0, \ldots, n$;

* $F = \mathbf{always}~G$ and $(\mathcal I, \pi^i) \models_{n-i} G$ for all $i = 0, \ldots, n$.

The semantics of the propositional connectives $\lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$
and the quantifier $\forall$
is again defined by reduction to the connectives above.
Intuitively, $n$-satisfiability specifies when a formula is true over
the first $n$ states of a trace.

> [!NOTE]
This notion is well defined even when $n=0$ regardless of whether $F$
is a two-state formula (having free occurrences of variables from
$\boldsymbol{x'}$) or not.
In the atomic case, this is true because $\pi$, for being an _infinite_ trace,
does contain the state $\pi[1]$, providing values for $\boldsymbol{x'}$.
In the general case, the claim can be shown by a simple inductive argument.

The notion of $n$-satisfiability is useful when one is interested, as we are,
in state reachability.
The reason is that a state satisfying a (non-temporal) state property $R$ is
reachable in a system $S$
only if the temporal formula $\mathbf{eventually}~R$ is $n$-satisfied
by an execution of $S$ for some $n$.
Note, however, that the converse does not hold.
That is, it is possible for $R$ to be reachable in a system $S$
without being $n$-satisfied by an execution of $S$.
See Section [todo](#add_link) for more details.

## The MoXI Intermediate Language

MoXI assumes a discrete and linear notion of time and adopts
the trace-based semantics defined in the previous section.
As mentioned earlier, it builds on the SMT-LIB language,
extending it with commands to represent transition systems and
to specify properties or queries.
It also standardizes a format for witnesses generated by tool
for checking MoXI models.

### Supported SMT-LIB Commands

SMT-LIB is a command-based language with LISP-like syntax
([s-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression), in prefix notation)
designed to be a common input/output language for SMT solvers.

MoXI adopts the following SMT-LIB commands:

* <tt>(declare-sort $s$ $n$)</tt>

  Declares $s$ to be a sort symbol (i.e., type constructor) of arity $n$.
  Examples:

  ```smt
  (declare-sort A 0)
  (declare-sort Set 1)
  ; possible sorts: A, (Set A), (Set (Set A)), (Array Int Real), ...
  ```

* <tt>(define-sort $s$ ( $u_1$ $\cdots$ $u_n$) $\tau$)</tt>

  Defines $S$ as synonym of a parametric type $\tau$ with parameters $u_1 \cdots u_n$.
  Examples:

  ```smt
  (declare-sort NestedSet (X) (Set (Set X)))
  ; possible sorts: (NestedSet A), ...
  (declare-sort Array2 (X Y) (Array X (Array X Y)))
  ; possible sorts: (Array2 Int Bool), ...
  ```

* <tt>(declare-const $c$ $\sigma$)</tt>

  Declares a constant $c$ of sort $\sigma$.
  Examples:
  
  ```smt
  (declare-const a A)
  (declare-const n Int)
  ```

* <tt>(define-fun $f$ ( ($x_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $x_1$ $\sigma_1$ )) $\sigma$ $t$)</tt>

  Defines a (non-recursive) function $f$ with inputs $x_1, \ldots, x_n$
  (of respective sort $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n$), output sort $\sigma$, and body $t$.
  Examples:

  ```smt
  (declare-fun sq ((n Int)) Int (* n n))
  (declare-fun isSqRoot ((m Int) (n Int)) Bool (= n (sq m)))
  (declare-fun max ((m Int) (n Int)) Int (ite (> m n) m n))
  ```

* <tt>(set-logic $L$)</tt>

  Defines the model's _data logic_, that is, the background theories
  of relevant data types
  (e.g., integers, reals, bit vectors, and so on)
  as well as the language of allowed logical constraints
  (e.g., quantifier-free, linear, etc.).

  ```smt
  (set-logic QF_BV)
  ```

One addition to SMT-LIB is the binary symbol <tt>!=</tt> for disequality.
For each term <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt> of the same sort, 
<tt>(!= s t)</tt> has the same meaning as <tt>(not (= s t))</tt> 
or, equivalently, <tt>(distinct s t)</tt>.

### MoXI-specific Commands

MoXI adds three commands to SMT-LIB:
<tt>declare-enum-sort</tt>,
<tt>define-system</tt>, and
<tt>check-system</tt>

The first has the form

<tt>(declare-enum-sort $s$ ( $c_1$ $\cdots$ $c_n$) )</tt>

where $s$, and $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ are SMT-LIB symbols.
It declares an enumeration sort $s$ with (distinct) values $c_1, \ldots, c_n$.

The other two commands are discussed in detail in the next two sections.

### System Definition Command

MoXI allows the definition of a model as the composition of one or more systems.
MoXI â€™s system definition commands follow the SMT-LIB syntax
for attribute-value pairs.

#### Atomic Systems

An atomic transition system with $m$ inputs, $n$ outputs, and $p$ local variables
is defined by a command of the form:

<tt>(define-system $S$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:input ( ($i_1$ $\delta_1$) $\cdots$ ($i_m$ $\delta_m $) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:output ( ($o_1$ $\tau_1$) $\cdots$ ( $o_n$ $\tau_n$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:local ( ($l_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $l_p$ $\sigma_p$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:init $I$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:trans $T$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:inv $P$</tt><br>
</tt>)</tt>

where

* $S$ is the system's identifier;
* each $i_j$ is an _input_ variable of sort $\delta_j$;
* each $o_j$ is an _output_ variable of sort $\tau_j$;
* each $l_j$ is a _local_ variable of sort $\sigma_j$;
* all variables above are distinct;
* each $i_j$, $o_j$, $l_j$ denote _current-state_ values;
* _next-state variables_ are not provided explicitly but are denoted
  by convention by appending $'$ to the names of the current-state variables
  $i_j$, $o_j$, and $l_j$;
* $I$, _the initial condition_, is a one-state formula
  over the unprimed system's variables (input, output and local state variables)
  that expresses a constraint on the initial states of $S$;
* $T$, _the transition condition,_ is a two-state formula
  over all of the system's variables (primed and unprimed)
  that expresses a constraint on the state transitions of $S$;
* $P$, _the invariance condition_, is a one state formula
  over all of the _unprimed_ system's variables
  that expresses a constraint on all reachable states of $S$;
* all attributes are optional but can occur at most once;
* the order of the attributes is immaterial except that
  <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt>, and <tt>:local</tt> must occur before
  <tt>:init</tt>, <tt>:trans</tt>, and <tt>:inv</tt>;
* the default value for a missing attribute is the empty list <tt>()</tt>
  for <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt>, and <tt>:local</tt>;
  and <tt>true</tt> for <tt>:init</tt>, <tt>:trans</tt>, and <tt>:inv</tt>.
  
Syntactically, the system's identifier, input, output and local variables are
SMT-LIB symbols.
In contrast, the sorts $\delta_j$, $\tau_j$, $\sigma_j$ are SMT-LIB sorts,
while the formulas $I$, $T$ and $P$ are SMT-LIB terms of type <tt>Bool</tt>.

<!--
The various aspects of the system are provided as SMT-LIB attribute-value pairs.
The order of the attributes can be arbitrary but each attribute can occur at most once.
A missing attribute stands for a default value:
the empty list <tt>()</tt> for <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt> and <tt>:local</tt>; and
<tt>true</tt> for <tt>:init</tt>, <tt>:trans</tt> and <tt>:inv</tt>.
-->

> **Discussion:**
We could allow multiple occurrences of the :inv attribute with conjunctive semantics.
Should we allow multiple occurrences of the :trans attribute but with _disjunctive_
semantics?
The rationale would be to facilitate the recognition of systems defined
by alternative sets of transitions.

##### Atomic System Semantics

Let
$\boldsymbol{i} = (i_1, \ldots, i_m)$,
$\boldsymbol{o} = (o_1, \ldots, o_n)$,
$\boldsymbol{l} = (l_1, \ldots, l_p)$,
and
$\boldsymbol{x}$ = $\boldsymbol{i},\boldsymbol{o},\boldsymbol{l}$.

Formally, an atomic system $S$ introduced by the <tt>define-system</tt> command above
is a transition system whose behavior consists of all the (infinite) executions 
$(\mathcal I, \pi)$ over $\boldsymbol{x}$ such that

$$(\mathcal I, \pi) \models
  I[\boldsymbol{x}] \land \mathbf{always}\ (P[\boldsymbol{x}] \land T[\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}]) \ .
$$

We call $I_S = I[\boldsymbol{x}]$ _the initial state predicate_ of $S$ and
$T_S = P[\boldsymbol{x}] \land T[\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}]$ _the transition predicate_ of $S$.

> [!NOTE]
The relation expressed by the formula $T$ is not required to be functional
over $\boldsymbol{i},\boldsymbol{o},\boldsymbol{l},\boldsymbol{i'}$,
thus allowing the modeling of non-deterministic systems.

> [!NOTE]
The <tt>:inv</tt> attribute is not strictly necessary since a system
with a  declaration of the form
>
>  <tt>(define-system $S$ :input ( ($i_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $i_m$ $\sigma_m$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:output ( ($o_1$ $\tau_1$) $\cdots$ ( $o_n$ $\tau_n$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:local ( ($l_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $l_p$ $\sigma_p$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:init $I$</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:trans $T$</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:inv $P$</tt><br>
>  <tt>)</tt>
>
> can be equivalently expressed with a declaration of the form
>
>  <tt>(define-system $S$ :input ( ($i_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $i_m$ $\sigma_m$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:output ( ($o_1$ $\tau_1$) $\cdots$ ( $o_n$ $\tau_n$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:local ( ($l_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $l_p$ $\sigma_p$) )</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:init $I$</tt><br>
>  <tt>&nbsp;:trans (and $P$ $T$)</tt><br>
>  <tt>)</tt>
>

> [!NOTE]
Systems are meant to be progressive: every reachable state has a successor
with respect $T_S$ for every possible next-state input.
However, they may not be because of the generality of $T$ and $P$.
In other words, it is possible to define deadlocking systems.
(See later for more details on deadlocked states.)

##### Examples â€” atomic systems

(Adapted from "Principles of Cyber-Physical Systems" by R. Alur, 2015)

When reading these examples, it is helpful to keep in mind that, intuitively,
_in the initial conditions, the input values are given_ and the local and output
values are to be defined, or more generally, constrained with respect to the given ones.
In contrast,
_in the transition conditions, the new input values, and old input,
output and local values are given_, and the new local and output values are
to be constrained with respect to the given ones.

The output of system <tt>Delay</tt> below is initially <tt>0</tt> and
then is the previous input.
No local variables are needed.

```smt
(define-system Delay :input ( (i Int) ) :output ( (o Int) )
 :init (= o 0)
 :trans (= o' i) ; the new output is the old input
)
```

A variant of <tt>Delay</tt> where the output is initially any number in [0,10].

```smt
(define-system Delay :input ( (i Int) ) :output ( (o Int) )
 :init (<= 0 o 10) ; more than one possible initial output
 :trans (= o' i)
)
```

A clocked lossless channel, stuttering when the clock is not ticking.
The clock is represented by a Boolean input variable <tt>clock</tt>.

```smt
(define-system StutteringClockedCopy
 :input ((clock Bool) (i Int))
 :output ((o Int))
 :init (=> clock (= o i)) ; o is arbitrary when clock is false 
 :trans (ite clock (= oâ€™ iâ€™) (= oâ€™ o)) ; ite is if-then-else
)
```

Events carrying data can be modeled as instances
of the polymorphic algebraic datatype <tt>(Event X)</tt>
where <tt>X</tt> is the type of the data carried by the event.

```smt
(declare-datatype Event (par (X) (
  (absent)
  (present (val X))
)))
```

An event-triggered channel that arbitrarily loses its input data.

```smt
(define-system LossyIntChannel
 :input ((i (Event Int)))
 :output ((o (Event Int)))
 :inv (or (= o i) (= o absent))
)
```

Equivalent formulation using unconstrained local state.

```smt
(define-system LossyIntChannel
 :input ((i (Event Int))) 
 :output ((o (Event Int)))
 :local ((s Bool))
 ; at all times, whether the input event is transmitted 
 ; or not depends on value of s
 :inv (= o (ite s i absent))
)
```

<tt>TimedSwitch</tt> models a timed light switch where the light stays
on for at most 10 steps unless it is switched off before.
The input Boolean is interpreted as an on/off toggle.
The transition predicate is formulated as a set of transitions.

```smt
(declare-enum-sort LightStatus (on off))

(define-system TimedSwitch1
 :input ( (press Bool) )
 :output ( (sig Bool) )
 :local ( (s LightStatus) (n Int) )
 :inv (= sig (= s on))
 :init (and
   (= n 0)
   (ite press (= s on) (= s off))
 )
 :trans (let
  (; transitions
   (stay-off (and (= s off) (not press') (= s' off) (= n' n)))
   (turn-on  (and (= s off) press' (= s' on) (= n' n)))
   (stay-on  (and (= s on) (not press') (< n 10) (= s' on) (= n' (+ n 1))))
   (turn-off (and (= s on) (or press' (>= n 10)) (= s' off) (= n' 0)))
  )
  (or stay-off turn-on turn-off stay-on)
 )
)
```

A variant of the system above where the transition predicate is formulated
guarded-transitions style.

```smt
(define-system TimedSwitch2
 :input ( (press Bool) )
 :output ( (sig Bool) )
 :local ( (s LightStatus) (n Int) )
 :inv (= sig (= s on))
 :init (and
    (= n 0)
    (ite press (= s on) (= s off))
  )
 :trans (and
   (=> (and (= s off) (not press'))
       (and (= s' off) (= n' n)))            ; off --> off
   (=> (and (= s off) press')
       (and (= s' on) (= n' n)))             ; off --> on
   (=> (and (= s on) (not press') (< 10 n))
        (and (= s' on) (= n' (+ n 1))))      ; on --> on
   (=> (and (= s on) (or press' (>= n 10)))
       (and (= s' off) (= n' 0)))            ; on --> off
  )
)
```

Another variant but in equational style.

```smt
(define-fun flip ((s LightStatus)) LightStatus
  (ite (= s off) on off)
)

(define-system TimedSwitch3
 :input ( (press Bool) )
 :output ( (sig Bool) )
 :local ( (s LightStatus) (n Int) )
 :inv (= sig (= s on))
 :init (and
   (= n 0)
   (= s (ite press on off))
 )
 :trans (and
   (= s' (ite press' (flip s)
            (ite (or (= s off) (>= n 10)) off
              on)))
   (= n' (ite (or (= s off) (= s' off)) 0
            (+ n 1)))
  )
)
```

The non-deterministic arbiter below grants input requests expressed
by the Boolean inputs <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt>.
A request is always granted,
expressed by the Boolean outputs <tt>g1</tt> or <tt>grant2</tt>,
if it is the only request.
When both inputs contain a request, one of the two request is granted,
with a non-deterministic  choice.
Since the output depends only on the current values of input and
local variables, the systems can be specified simply by an invariant.

```smt
(define-system NonDetArbiter
 :input ( (r1 Bool) (r2 Bool) )
 :output ( (g1 Bool) (g2 Bool) )
 :local ( (s Bool) )
 :inv (and
  (=> (and (not r1) (not r2))
      (and (not g1) (not g2)))
  (=> (and r1 (not r2))
      (and g1 (not g2)))
  (=> (and (not r1) r2)
      (and (not g1) g2))
  (=> (and r1 r2)
      ; the unconstrained value of `s` is used as non-deterministic choice
      (ite s (and g1 (not g2))
        (and (not g1) g2)))
  )
)
```

The next arbiter is similar to <tt>NonDetArbiter</tt> but grants requests
a cycle later and does not use a local variable for the non-deterministic choice.

```smt
(define-system DelayedArbiter
 :input ( (r1 Bool) (r2 Bool) )
 :output ( (g1 Bool) (g2 Bool) )
 :local ( (s Bool) )
 :init ( and (not g1) (not g2) )  ; nothing is granted initially
 :trans (and
    (=> (and (not r1) (not r2))
        (and (not g1') (not g2')))
    (=> (and r1 (not r2))
        (and g1' (not g2')))
    (=> (and (not r1) r2)
        (and (not g1') g2'))
    (=> (and r1 r2)
        (!= g1' g2'))
  )
)
```

Similar to <tt>DelayedArbiter</tt> but for requests expressed as integer events.

```smt
(define-system IntNonDetArbiter
  :input ( (r1 (Event Int)) (r2 (Event Int)) )
  :output ( (g1 (Event Int)) (g2 (Event Int)) )
  :local ( (s Bool) )
  :init (= g1 g2 absent)
  :trans (and
    (=> (= r1' r2' absent)
        (= g1' g2' absent))
    (=> (and (!= r1' absent) (= r2' absent))
        (and (= g1' r1) (= g2' absent)))
    (=> (and (= r1' absent) (!= r2' absent))
        (and (= g1' absent) (= g2' r2')))
    (=> (and (!= r1' absent) (!= r2' absent))
        (or (and (= g1' r1') (= g2' absent))
          (and (= g1' absent) (= g2' r2'))))
  )
)
```

#### Composite Systems â€” synchronous composition

Transition systems can also be defined as the synchronous[^1] composition
of other systems by a command of the form:

<tt>(define-system $S$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:input ( ($i_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $i_m$ $\sigma_m$) )</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:output ( ($o_1$ $\tau_1$) $\cdots$ ( $o_n$ $\tau_n$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:local ( ($l_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $l_p$ $\sigma_p$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:subsys ( $N_1$ ( $S_1$ $\boldsymbol x_1$ $\boldsymbol y_1$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; $\cdots$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:subsys ( $N_q$ ( $S_q$ $\boldsymbol x_q$ $\boldsymbol y_q$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:init $I$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:trans $T$</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:inv $P$</tt><br>
<tt>)</tt>

where
* <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt>, <tt>:local</tt> <tt>:init</tt>, <tt>:trans</tt>, and <tt>:inv</tt> 
  are as in atomic system definitions;
* $q > 0$ and each $S_i$ is the name of a system other than $S$;
* the names $S_1 \ldots,S_q$ need not be all distinct;
* each $N_i$ is a local synonym for $S_i$, with $N_1,\ldots,N_q$ distinct;
* each $\boldsymbol x_i$ consists of $S$'s variables of the same sort as $S_i$'s input;
* each $\boldsymbol y_i$ consists of $S$'s local/output variables of the same sort
  as $S_i$'s output;
* the directed subsystem graph rooted at $S$ is acyclic.

##### Composite System Semantics

For $k=1,\ldots, q$, let
$S_k = (I_k[\boldsymbol{i}_k,\boldsymbol{o}_k,\boldsymbol{l}_k], T_k[\boldsymbol{i}_k,\boldsymbol{o}_k,\boldsymbol{l}_k,\boldsymbol{i'}_k,\boldsymbol{o'}_k,\boldsymbol{l'}_k])$,
with the elements of $\boldsymbol{l}_1,\ldots, \boldsymbol{l}_q$ all mutually distinct.

Let
$\boldsymbol{i} = (i_1, \ldots, i_m)$,
$\boldsymbol{o} = (o_1, \ldots, o_n)$,
$\boldsymbol{l} = (l_1, \ldots, l_p),  \boldsymbol{l}_1,  \ldots,  \boldsymbol{l}_q$,
and
$\boldsymbol{x}$ = $\boldsymbol{i},  \boldsymbol{o},  \boldsymbol{l}$.

Formally, a composite system $S$ introduced by the <tt>define-system</tt> command
above is a transition system whose behavior consists of all the (infinite) executions
$(\mathcal I, \pi)$ over $\boldsymbol{x}$ such that

$$(\mathcal I, \pi) \models
  I_S[\boldsymbol{x}] \land \mathbf{always}\ T_S[\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}]
$$

where

* $I_S[\boldsymbol{x}] = I[\boldsymbol{x}] \land \bigwedge_{k=1,\ldots,q} I_k[\boldsymbol{x}_k,\boldsymbol{y}_k,\boldsymbol{l}_k]$ <br>
and
* $T_S[\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}] = P[\boldsymbol{x}] \land T[\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}] \land \bigwedge_{k=1,\ldots,q} T_k[\boldsymbol{x}_k,\boldsymbol{y}_k,\boldsymbol{l}_k, \boldsymbol{x'}_k,\boldsymbol{y'}_k,\boldsymbol{l'}_k]$

```

The next example defines a three-bit counter in terms of three identical
one-bit counters.
The one-bit counter uses a latch.
The latch has a Boolean state represented by state variable <tt>s</tt> with arbitrary
initial value.
The value of output <tt>out</tt> is always the previous value of <tt>s</tt>.
A set request (represented by input <tt>set</tt> being true) sets the new value
of <tt>s</tt> to true unless there is a concurrent reset request
(represented by input <tt>reset</tt> being true).
In that case, the choice between the two requests is resolved arbitrarily using
the value of the unconstrained local variable <tt>b</tt>.
In the absence of either a set or a reset, the value of <tt>out</tt> is unchanged.

```smt
(define-system Latch  :input ( (set Bool) (reset Bool) )  :output ( (out Bool)) 
 :local ( (s Bool) (b Bool) )
 :init (and
   (= out b)
 )
 :trans (and
   (= out' s)
   (= s' (or (and set (or (not reset) b)) 
             (and (not set) (not reset) out)))
 )
)
```

The one-bit counter is implemented using the latch component modeled by `Latch`.
The counter goes from 0 (represented as <tt>false</tt>) to 1 (<tt>true</tt>)
with a carry value of 0, or from 1 to 0 with a carry value of 1 when
the increment signal <tt>inc</tt> is true.
It is reset to 0 (<tt>false</tt>) when the start signal is true.
The initial value of the counter is arbitrary.

The three-bit counter is a resettable counter obtained by cascading
three 1-bit counters.
The output is three Boolean values standing for the three bits,
with <tt>out0</tt> being the least significant one.

#### System Sanity Requirements

Because of the infinite trace semantics every system defined in MoXI is expected
to execute forever.
In such semantics, the reachability of a _deadlocked state_
(i.e., a state with no successors in the transition relation) indicates the presence
of an error in the system's definition.
In fact, since these are systems with inputs, the requirements are typically
even more stringent:
a state should have a successor _for every possible next-state input_.

Intuitively, for a system definition to define a deadlock-free system,
the following must hold for the variables
$\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{o}, \boldsymbol{l}$ and
their primed versions.:

1. Every assignment of values to the input variables $\boldsymbol{i}$ can be extended
   to an assignment to $\boldsymbol{x}$ that satisfies $I_S[\boldsymbol{x}]$.

2. For every reachable state $s$ (i.e., assignment to the variables $\boldsymbol{x}$),
   every assignment to the primed input variables $\boldsymbol{i'}$
   can be extended to an assignment $s'$ to $\boldsymbol{x'}$ so that
   $s,s'$ satisfies $T_S$[$\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x'}$].

The first restriction above guarantees that the system can start at all.
The second ensures that from any reachable state and for any new input,
the system can move to another state (_and so_ also produce output).
Given a backgrount theory $\mathcal T$,

* a sufficient condition for (1) is that the following formula is valid in $\mathcal T$:

  $$\forall \boldsymbol{i}\, \exists \boldsymbol{o}\, \exists \boldsymbol{l}\, I_S$$

* a sufficient condition for (2) is that the following formula is valid in $\mathcal T$:

  $$\forall \boldsymbol{i}~ \forall \boldsymbol{o}~ \forall \boldsymbol{l}~
    \forall \boldsymbol{i'}~
    \exists \boldsymbol{o'}~ \exists \boldsymbol{l'}~ T_S
  $$

  Note that this condition is not a necessary condition as it needs not apply to unreachable
  states.
  Let $\textrm{Reachable}[\boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{o}, \boldsymbol{l}]$ denote
  the (possibly higher-order) formula satisfied exactly by the reachable states
  of $S$.
  Then, a more accurate sufficient condition for (2) above would be the validity 
  in $\mathcal T$ of the formula:

  $$\forall \boldsymbol{i}~ \forall \boldsymbol{o}~ \forall \boldsymbol{l}~
    \forall \boldsymbol{i'}~
    \exists \boldsymbol{o'}~ \exists \boldsymbol{l'}~
     \textrm{Reachable} \Rightarrow T_S[\boldsymbol{i}, \boldsymbol{o}, \boldsymbol{l}]
  $$

> [!NOTE]
> In general, checking the two sufficient conditions above automatically can be
> impossible or very expensive because of the quantifier alternations in the conditions.

### System Checking Command

The properties to check for a (possibly composite) defined system are specified using 
the following command for defining _queries_ on the systemâ€™s behavior.

<tt>(check-system $S$</tt> <br>
<tt>&nbsp;:input ( ($i_1$ $\delta_1$) $\cdots$ ( $i_m$ $\delta_m$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:output ( ($o_1$ $\tau_1$) $\cdots$ ( $o_n$ $\tau_n$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:local ( ($l_1$ $\sigma_1$) $\cdots$ ( $l_p$ $\sigma_p$) ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:assumption ( $a$ A ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:fairness ( $f$ $F$ ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:reachable ( $r$ $R$ ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:current ( $c$ $C$ ) </tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:query ( $q$ ( $g_1$ $\cdots$ $g_q$) )</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;:queries ( ($q_1$ ( $g_{1,1}$ $\cdots$ $g_{1,n_1}$ )) $\cdots$ ( $q_t$ ( $g_{t,1}$ $\cdots$ $g_{t,n_t}$) ) )</tt><br>
<tt>)</tt>

where

* $S$ is the identifier of a previously defined system with $m$ inputs, $n$ outputs,
  and $p$ local variables;
* all attributes are optional and their order is immaterial except that
  <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt>, <tt>:local</tt>, have to come
  before the other attributes [may not need this restriction];
* all attributes except for <tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt> and <tt>:local</tt>
  are repeatable.
* $\boldsymbol{i} = (i_1, \ldots, i_m)$ is a renaming of the corresponding
  input variables of $S$ of sort $\boldsymbol{\delta} = (\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_m)$;
* $\boldsymbol{o} = (o_1, \ldots, o_n)$ is a renaming of the corresponding
  output variables of $S$ of sort $\boldsymbol{\tau} = (\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n)$;
* $\boldsymbol{l} = (l_1, \ldots, l_p)$ is a renaming of the corresponding
  local variables of $S$ of sort $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_p)$;
* $a$, $r$, $f$, $c$, $q$, $q_1, \ldots, q_k$ are identifiers;
* $A$ is (non-temporal) formula over the system variables
  $\boldsymbol{i}$, $\boldsymbol{o}$, $\boldsymbol{l}$, and $\boldsymbol{i'}$
  expressing an _environmental assumption_ on $\boldsymbol{i'}$;
* $F$ is (non-temporal) formula over the system variables
  $\boldsymbol{i}$, $\boldsymbol{o}$, $\boldsymbol{l}$, and $\boldsymbol{i'}$
  expressing a _fairness condition_ on $\boldsymbol{i'}$;
* $R$ is (non-temporal) formula over all the system variables, primed and unprimed,
  expressing a state _reachability condition_;
* $C$ is (non-temporal) formula over all the system variables
  $\boldsymbol{i}$, $\boldsymbol{o}$, $\boldsymbol{l}$
  expressing a state _initiality condition_;
* each $g_j$ and $g_{j,k}$ ranges over the $a$, $r$, $f$, $c$ identifiers;
* $(q\ (g_1 \cdots g_q))$ defines a query $q$ as consisting of the formulas named
  by $g_1, \dots, g_q$;
  the same holds for each $(q_j\ (g_{j,1} \cdots g_{j,n_j}))$;
* a query can contain more than one assumption, fairness condition and reachability
  condition but at most one initiality condition.

> [!NOTE]
When the command contains more than one instance of the attributes
<tt>:assumption</tt>, <tt>:reachable</tt>, <tt>:fairness</tt> and <tt>:current</tt>,
the list of elements of a query $q$ can refer to any of the identifiers
in those attributes.

> [!NOTE]
The order of the formula names in a query is immaterial.

#### Check-system Semantics

Each query ($q$ and each $q_j$) in the <tt>check-system</tt> command asks
for the existence of a trace.
The query is to be evaluated with infinite-state semantics if it includes at least
one fairness condition, and the finite-state semantics otherwise.

Given a check command like the above for a system $S$,
let $I_S$ and $T_S$ be the initial state and transition predicates of $S$
_modulo_ the variable renamings in the command.
The meaning of the query depends on its components.

Specifically, for a system $S$, let $I_S$ and $T_S$ be the initial state and 
transition predicates of $S$ modulo the variable renamings in the <tt>check-system</tt>
command.
Let $t, u, v  \geq 0$.
The semantics of queries are defined as follows:

(1) A $q$ query of the form
<tt>( $a_1$ $\cdots$ $a_t$ $r_1$ $\cdots$ $r_u$  )</tt>,
with each $a_j$ naming an assumption $A_j$ and
each $r_j$ naming a reachability condition $R_j$,
is _satisfiable_ iff the formula

$$

Let $\mathcal T$ be the background theory specified for an MoXI model.

For each satisfiable query in a <tt>check-system</tt> command,
the model checker is expected to produce

1. a $\mathcal T$-interpretation $\mathcal I$ of the (global) free symbols
   in the script;
2. a witnessing trace in $\mathcal I$.

The interpretation $\mathcal I$ _must be the same_ for all queries in
the same <tt>:queries</tt> attribute.
In contrast, queries in different attributes may each have their own
interpretation of the free symbols.
Regardless of where it occurs, each query may have its own witnessing trace.

For each unsatisfiable query, the model checker may return a proof certificate for that queryâ€™s unsatisfiability.

> **Note**:
To enforce the infinite state semantics for an query it is enough for it
to contain any fairness condition, including the valid formula <tt>true</tt>.
>
> **Note**:
For queries with no fairness conditions, the witnessing trace may not be
a trace of the system. [Elaborate]
>
> **Note**:
The witnessing trace for a query may satisfy each reachability condition
in the query in a different state.

#### Check-system Examples

[Non-deterministic arbiter.]

```smt
(check-system NonDetArbiter
 :input ( (req1 Bool) (req2 Bool) )
 :output ( (gr1 Bool) (gr2 Bool) )
 ; There are never concurrent requests
 :assumption (a1 (not (and req1 req2)))
 ; The same request is never issued twice in a row
 :assumption (a2 (and (=> req1 (not req1')) (=> req2 (not req2'))))
 ; Neg of: every request is immediately granted
 :reachable (r (not (and (=> req1 gr1) (=> req2 gr2))))
 ; check the reachability of r under assumptions a1 and a2
 :query (q (a1 a2 r)) 
)
```

[Temporal queries.]

```smt
(define-system Historically :input ((b Bool)) :output ((hb Bool)) 
 :init (= hb b) 
 :trans (= hbâ€™ (and bâ€™ hb))
)

(define-system Before :input ((b Bool)) :output ((bb Bool)) 
 :init (= bb' false) 
 :trans (= bbâ€™ b)
)

(define-system Count :input ((b Bool)) :output ((c Int)) 
 :init (= c (ite b 1 0))
 :trans (= câ€™ (+ c (ite b 0 1)))
)

(define-system Monitor :input ((r1 Bool) (r2 Bool)) :output ((g1 Bool) (g2 Bool))  
 :local ((a1 Bool) (a2 Bool) (b Bool) (h1 Bool) (h2 Bool) (bf Bool) (c1 Int))
 :subsys (A (NonDetArbiter r1 r2 g1 g2))
 :subsys (H1 (Historically a1 h1))
 :subsys (H2 (Historically a2 h2))
 :subsys (C (Count g1 c1))
 :subsys (B (Before b bf))
 :inv (and
   ; a1 <=> no requests
   (= a1 (and (not r1) (not r2)))
   ; a2 <=> no grants
   (= a2 (and (not g1) (not g2)))
   ; b <=> c1 is 4
   (= b (= c1 4))
 )
)

(check-system Monitor :input ((r1 Bool) (r2 Bool)) :output ((g1 Bool) (g2 Bool))
 :local ((a1 Bool) (a2 Bool) (b Bool) (h1 Bool) (h2 Bool) (bf Bool) (c1 Int))
 ; no concurrent requests
 :assumption (A (not (and r1 r2))) 
 ; neg of: if there have been no requests, there have been no grants 
 :reachable (P1 (not (=> h1 h2))) 
 ; neg of: a request is granted at most 4 times
 :reachable (P2 (not (=> bf (not g1)))) 
 :query (Q1 (A P1))
 :query (Q2 (A P2))
)
```

#### Check-system Response

MoXI also defines the content and format of possible responses
(from the model checker) to a <tt>check-system</tt> command.
Witness traces returned by the model checker are currently limited to _lasso traces_,
that is, traces of the form $pl^\omega$,
where $p$ and $l$ are finite sequences of states, or _trails_.

Each witness is then represented by two trails:

* a _prefix trail_ $p$  and
* a _lasso trail_ $l$.

A witness trace is then an infinite trace that starts with a prefix $p$
and continues with a infinite repetitions of a trail $l$
(meaning that the last state of $l$ loops back to the first state of $l$).
In contrast, a proof certificate for a trace represents a proof of the unsatisfiability
of the query.
Currently, MoXI does not specify the format of proof certificates except for requiring
The response to a <tt>check-system</tt> comment is expected to contain one witness trace
or proof certificate for each query in the command.

Each response is an s-expression starting with <tt>check-system-response</tt>
and listing several attributes with their values.
The format of the response can be _verbose_ or _compact_.
This is indicated by the value <tt>full</tt> or <tt>compact</tt> 
of the attribute <tt>:verbosity</tt>.

##### Verbose Response

[to do]

**Verbose** response with input var `i`, output var `o`, local var `s`,
reachability pred `r`, and fairness condition `f`.

```scheme
(check-system-response
 :verbosity full
 :query (q1 :result sat :model m :trace t)
 :query (q2 :result unsat :certificate c)
 :query (q3 :result unknown)                         ; for timeouts and other cases
 :trace (t :prefix p :lasso l)                       ; t = pl^Ï‰
 :model (m M)                                        ; M is model in SMT-LIB format
 :trail (p ( (0 (i iâ‚€) (o oâ‚€) (s sâ‚€) (r râ‚€) (f fâ‚€))  ; numbered state/valuation
              ...
             (j (i iâ±¼) (o oâ±¼) (s sâ±¼) (r râ±¼) (f fâ±¼))
           )
        ) 
 :trail (l ( (... ) ... ( ...) ))
 :certificate (c :inv F :k n)
)
```

##### Compact Response

The **compact** response format is identical to the verbose one except that
each trail starts with a fully specified state and continues with states
that list only the variables whose value differs from their value
in the previous state.
